### ‚ú® Featured Project: Predicting Credit Card Default Risk

This was a comprehensive capstone project for my Master of Science in Business Analytics at the University of Central Oklahoma. Our team delved into predicting credit card default risk, with a novel focus on the impact of migrant worker status.

**Project Goal:**
To develop robust predictive models for credit card defaults using an American Express customer dataset, aiming to enhance risk management practices and promote financial inclusivity, particularly for underrepresented groups like migrant workers.

**My Role & Key Contributions:**
*(As this was a group project, you can specify your primary contributions here. For example: "I focused on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development/evaluation of [specific models, e.g., Logistic Regression and Neural Network models] using SAS Miner.")*

* Collaborated on extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling inconsistencies (e.g., age vs. employment duration), imputing missing values (mean/mode imputation), and treating outliers using log transformations.
* Conducted in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns, correlations, and feature engineer new variables like 'Years Employed' and 'Occupation Group'.
* Participated in the development and rigorous evaluation of 26 machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic Regression variants (Stepwise, PLS, LASSO), Neural Networks, and SVMs, utilizing SAS Miner.
* Analyzed model performance under two scenarios: one including all credit-related variables, and another excluding them to isolate the predictive power of non-financial factors.
* Contributed to the statistical analysis, performing T-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-Square tests to validate variable significance.

**Key Insights & Outcomes:**
* **High Accuracy with Credit Variables:** The Random Forest model (200 trees) achieved 96% accuracy when credit-related variables were included, with 'Credit Score' and 'Credit Limit Used (%)' being the most dominant predictors.
* **Impact of Non-Credit Variables:** When credit variables were excluded, factors like 'Owns Car', 'No. of Years Employed', 'Gender', 'Net Yearly Income', 'Occupation Type', and importantly, 'Migrant Worker' status became significant predictors.
* **Migrant Worker Status:** This demographic showed marginally higher odds of default (1.06 times higher in non-credit models), highlighting their unique financial challenges and the need for tailored financial products and risk assessment strategies.
* **Financial Inclusivity:** The study underscored the potential for financial institutions to refine their models to be more inclusive of individuals with non-traditional credit histories, balancing risk and social equity.

**Technologies Used:** SAS E-Miner, Python (Programming Language), SQL (for data understanding and conceptual design), Data Analysis, Machine Learning.
